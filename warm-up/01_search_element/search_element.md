### Search Element

Write a function that searches for an element in an array and returns the index, if the element is not present then just return -1

**Example 1:**

> Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 11
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: Because 11 is present at 2nd index in nums array

**Example 2:**

> Input: nums = [1,5,8,2,9,0], target = 7
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation: Because 7 is not present at any position/index in nums array
